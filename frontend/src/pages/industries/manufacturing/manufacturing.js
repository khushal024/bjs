                  In the hospitality sector, customer experience is everything.
                  The tiniest slip-up can have significant consequences in terms
                  of legalities, reputations, public perception, and brand

                  While you might be a pro in your core business proposition,
                  there are aspects of business like financial planning, account

                  attention they deserve.

            Outsourced services handle aspects of your business that are critical yet not the core proposition for your business. For a restaurant, its food will be the core proposition, but human resource management, despite being critical, will not be the most important thing on its list.

                  Human Resources (HR) involves ensuring proper regulatory compliance and well being of all your employees. This includes tracking work hours, compensation for overtime, provisions for paid leaves, etc. Managing Human Resources is time-consuming, yet even the smallest mistakes in HR management can snowball into large legal battles. We at BJS ensure your employees give their maximum performance while still being mentally stable, healthy, and overall satisfied. Proper employee benefits, insurance, bonuses, and more are designed to keep morale high.

                  Let’s say there’s a major festival coming up. You would want to invest in additional resources, workforce, and decorations to attract and serve customers properly. To be able to execute it, you would need a lot of savings and planning. Most people are not very good at it. Fortunately, BJS offers financial consultation to help you effectively plan, save, and optimise your business for all upcoming financial activities. Our consultants also advise you on suitable price hikes to appropriately leverage the festival rush, balancing profits and sales.

                  Hospitality is largely a process-driven industry. There are certain processes in the life cycle of each customer that must operate with perfection for an ideal consumer experience. We help identify areas for improvement, improve efficiencies to save money, and redesign procedures to ensure your costs are minimal.

                  <p>
                  Our revolutionary sales procedures combine the marketing and sales departments to ensure that the customer is never left high and dry anywhere between lead generation and onboarding. For example, as a tourist agency, your marketing team might have generated leads from prospective customers. But, our slow sales team wasn’t properly made aware of the special needs and concerns of clients, resulting in offers getting rejected. Instead, our unified team understands the customer, curates plans, and ensures proper communication and care until the sale is complete.

Most of the times, our field agent management services can reduce cost overruns, optimise processes, and bring massive efficiency boost for firms.
